# **Jakob Kasper**, MSc Psychology

<img src="jakob.jpg" class="headshot"/>

I am a third-year **PhD candidate** at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/profiel/k/a/j.kasper/j.kasper.html) (Amsterdam School of Communication Research) affiliated with the doctoral network [Interdisciplinary Perspectives on the Politics of Adolescence and Democracy](https://www.ippad.eu/), the [Hot Politics Lab](https://www.hotpolitics.eu/), and the [Center for Politics and Communication](https://www.polcomm.org/about-2/).

My research focuses on ***affective polarization***. I explore how it can be measured within ***multi-party systems*** by examining large and ideologically diverse political groups. I also aim to connect political science’s understanding of affective polarization with psychological ***theories of affect***, refining both theoretical frameworks and measurement tools to more accurately capture its ***affective nature***. Additionally, I investigate how affective polarization develops during ***adolescence***, seeking to understand its origins and address concerns about the possibility of increasing polarization among younger generations.

Before my PhD, I received a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Psychology from the University of Heidelberg (Germany) and spent one year as a graduate exchange student at Cornell University (USA).
